1. https://superuser.com/questions/446395/is-it-the-address-bus-size-or-the-data-bus-size-that-determines-8-bit-16-bit
    Generally the size of the databus is determined by the the size of the processor registers. 
    Often it is the size of the processor registers that determine the OS type (64 vs 32).

6. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6716946/why-do-64-bit-systems-have-only-a-48-bit-address-space
   On doing cat /proc/cpuinfo I see address sizes	: 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual. hence the curiosity
   So CPU manufacturers took a shortcut. They use an instruction set which allows a full 64-bit address space, 
   but current CPUs just only use the lower 48 bits. The alternative was wasting transistors on handling a bigger address space which wasn't going to be needed for many years.

Logical addresses are the memory addresses used in "regular" user-land code (e.g. the contents of rsi in mov eax, [rsi]).

8. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10844871/how-can-the-same-linux-program-load-memory-addresses-be-used-multiple-times-on-d?noredirect=1&lq=1
The answer is that each process has its own page tables. They are switched when processes are switched.
It's also worth noting that, fundamentally, "virtual memory" is a "hardware thing". Yes, the OS manages the page tables. But the actual mapping of a virtual address to a physical address is ultimately done by the system's VMM hardware, not by the OS. Hence, from the software's perspective, a "virtual address" (which, in theory, can map to a different physical address at any time) is as "real as it gets".

When using a struct to represent configuration bytes, it is very important that the compiler does not add any padding, because the struct will eventually be treated as a 32 bit unsigned integer by the hardware. The attribute packed can be used to force GCC to not add any padding:

existence of the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), which is the MMU's way of converting the virtual addresses used by a process to a physical memory address.
there is a single MMU per physical processor, at least in SMP systems, so all cores share a single MMU.
